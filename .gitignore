# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# IDea
*.iml
*.ipr
*.iws
*.ids
*.idea
.idea/

# OS X
.DS_Store

# Ignore RVM config
.rvmrc

# Ignore mistakenly committed temp files from Sublime Text 2
untitled

# Ignore gems
**.gem

# Test against latest versions that match requirements in Travis.
#
# Cons:
# * takes longer for Travis build :(
# * has the potential for someone not cleaning their gemfiles directories to have a diff
#   result than Travis, but allows faster local dev appraisals after the first is run
# * relies on Gemfile/.gemspec to be locked to minor versions of each dependency (even
#   though that is best practice).
#
# Pros: (which outweigh the cons, imo)
# * requires less maintenance to use more recent dependencies
# * get faster feedback after changes to dependencies
